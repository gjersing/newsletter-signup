# newsletter-signup

newsletter-signup is a simple project exploring a newsletter signup page.

Using Node, Express, Mailchimp, and Bootstrap, the site is able to gather a user's name and email and add them to a mailchimp list.

Hosted on Heroku.
Check out the app here: https://glacial-sands-48483.herokuapp.com/

The app redirects to a success or failure page depending on the API call response.
Try experimenting with real, fake, and repeated information to see different results.
I will not send any emails to the mailchimp list.
